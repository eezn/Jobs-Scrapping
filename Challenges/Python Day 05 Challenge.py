# Using the boilerplate, make a program that gets a list of countries from a website with their currency codes, then let the user choose a country and display the currency code of that country.
# This is part one of a bigger "country scrapping" project we will complete in the following days.
# This is how the program should work: https://i.imgur.com/Nh7nkjF.mp4

# The website you should get the countries and currencies from is: https://www.iban.com/currency-codes
# Save the name of the country and the "Alpha-3 code" in an array.
# Some countries don't have currency (No universal currency), don't add them to the list.
# Check the user input, only numbers from inside the country list are allowed.
# When a country is selected, show the name and currency code.

# try / except when converting strings to numbers (int(input()))
